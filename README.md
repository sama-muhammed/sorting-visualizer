# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer
The Sorting Algorithm Visualizer is a simple and educational web application built with React.js that demonstrates how different sorting algorithms organize data step by step.
Rather than complex animations, it focuses on showing the logic behind sorting how numbers are compared, swapped, and arranged into order.

# Algorithms Included

ðŸ”¹ Bubble Sort
This algorithm repeatedly goes through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
Each pass brings the largest element to the end of the array, similar to how bubbles rise to the top of water.
Best for beginners but slow for large datasets (O(nÂ²)).

ðŸ”¹ Insertion Sort
Builds a sorted section one element at a time.
It picks an element from the unsorted part and places it at the correct position in the sorted part.
Efficient for small datasets or when the array is almost sorted.

ðŸ”¹ Selection Sort
Divides the array into a sorted and unsorted part.
It finds the smallest element in the unsorted part and moves it to its correct position.
Simple to understand but not very efficient for large arrays.

ðŸ”¹ Merge Sort
A Divide and Conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, sorts them, and then merges them together.
Itâ€™s efficient with large datasets due to its O(n log n) time complexity.

ðŸ”¹ Quick Sort
Another Divide and Conquer algorithm that chooses a pivot and partitions the array into smaller and larger elements.
It then recursively sorts the partitions.
Extremely fast on average, making it widely used in real-world systems.

# Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### npm run build

Builds the app for production to the build folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### npm run eject

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can eject at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except eject will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use eject. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Educational Purpose
This project was developed to make understanding sorting algorithms easier and more interactive.
It helps users visualize logic flow, step tracking, and algorithm efficiency bridging the gap between code and concept.
